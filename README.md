# Data-Visualization-with-R

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is widely used for data analysis, particularly in the fields of statistics, data mining, and machine learning. R provides a wide range of tools and libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling, and is highly extensible, allowing users to create their own functions and packages to suit specific needs. R is also an open-source software, which means it can be freely downloaded and used by anyone.
